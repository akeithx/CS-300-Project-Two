# CS-300-Project-Two

  The problem I was solving in this course was creating a C++ program that is able to take in data from a file. This data needs to be placed in a list of data objects. This data needs to be able to be outputted, sorted and searched for. This allows the client to access its courses.
  I approached this problem by first deciding what data structure I would like to use to solve this problem. After going thorugh project one I was able to determine that a vector was the best solution for this problem. Going on from this I was able to code all the requirements of the client using this vector.
  I had a roadblock with sorting the vector. I could not find a way to sort the vector that was composed of courses. I ended up finding a good method by researching more and finally being able to sort the vector by using the key of the courseNumber.
